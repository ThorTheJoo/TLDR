## 🛡️ Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
```typescript
// SecurityUtils class provides:
- Phone number validation
- API key format validation
- Webhook URL validation
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
```

### 2. **Secure Error Handling**
```typescript
// Implemented secure error handling:
- Error messages sanitized before user display
- Sensitive data redacted from logs
- Rate limiting on error reporting
- Generic error messages for production
```

### 3. **Dependency Security**
```json
// Updated to secure versions:
- Expo: ~53.0.0 (latest)
- React Native: 0.76.3 (latest)
- All dependencies updated to latest secure versions
- Added security resolutions for known vulnerabilities
```

### 4. **Error Boundary Implementation**
```typescript
// Comprehensive error boundary:
- Graceful error handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Debug information in development only
- Error reporting capabilities
```

## 🔍 Code Quality Issues

### 1. **TypeScript Configuration**
- **Issue**: Outdated TypeScript target causing compilation issues
- **Fix**: Updated to ES2020 with proper lib configuration
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. **Missing Type Definitions**
- **Issue**: Missing @types packages for some dependencies
- **Fix**: Added proper type definitions and updated package.json
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 3. **Linting Configuration**
- **Issue**: ESLint configuration not comprehensive
- **Fix**: Enhanced ESLint rules for security and code quality
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## 🏗️ Architectural Security

### 1. **Redux Store Security**
- **Issue**: No input validation in Redux actions
- **Fix**: Added validation in service layer before Redux actions
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 2. **API Service Security**
- **Issue**: No rate limiting or input validation
- **Fix**: Implemented comprehensive validation and rate limiting
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

### 3. **Secure Storage**
- **Issue**: Sensitive data not properly encrypted
- **Fix**: Using Expo SecureStore for sensitive data
- **Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED
